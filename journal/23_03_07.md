Goal: Support functionality for mislabeled data.

Modify abstract dataset in datasets.py to include frac_mislabeled in constructor. fetch_train_example multiplexes between fetch_example and a new function fetch_random. Fetch random uses mislabels that were sampled i.i.d. uniformly (e.g. the same element can appear in multiple mislabels) during initialization and otherwise remain constant during training.
